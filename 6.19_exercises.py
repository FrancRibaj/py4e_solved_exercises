# string and works its way backwards to the first character in the string,
# printing each letter on a separate line, except backwards.'''

# word = "banana"
# # index = len(word) - 1

Exercise 5: Take the following Python code that stores a string:
str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the
colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted
string into a floating point number.
'''

# text = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475'
# number = text[text.find(":"):len(text)]
# float_number = float(number[1:])
# print(float_number)
